# Solution description
The DiverCity app is a celebration to Jane Jacobs theory of city diversity and its connection to city prosperity. Using several Open Data-sources from the Swedish authorities this app visualizes city diversity and the interesting phenomenons that occur where diversity exists.

#Demo

#Technology
The application uses <a href="https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js">BabylonJS</a> and WebGL to render datasets in an interactive way. Datasets can be toggled and combined to discover phenomenons in the interaction between the datasets.

#Credits
Thanks to the Swedish authorities and for the effort of opening up their data and special thanks goes to Naturv√•rdsverket for arranging the <a href="http://hackforsweden.se/">Hack4Sweden</a>-hackathon.
